# problems-puzzles-CP
Since I like spend some of my free time by completing coding challenges, I decided to create a repository where publish some solutions.
At the moment I'm focused on [Project euler](https://projecteuler.net/) and [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/text/2433) problems. I sometimes look also at [Jane street](https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/) puzzles but only in a curious way.

These programming challenges allow to strenghten my coding skills which is a different way to state that the code you are going to find is not always very optimized. It's something I'm working on :P
I mainly use MATLAB / Octave but I'm looking to try some of new coding languages. 

## Project Euler problems
As stated on its website, "Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems". From my point of view seems mainly focused on number theory.
In the following [folder](https://github.com/federicodeangelisscorsone/problems-puzzles-CP/tree/main/Project%20euler%20solutions) you'll find some solutions.

## CSES problems
The CSES Problem Set is a collection of algorithmic programming problems. I recently discover this website, so there are not many solutions. I'm giving it a bet.
In the following [folder](https://github.com/federicodeangelisscorsone/problems-puzzles-CP/tree/main/CSES%20solutions) you'll find some solutions.
